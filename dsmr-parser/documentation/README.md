A big unknown was the Device Type field used when an MBus attached device is used.

Although I'm not 100% sure the only documentation that I have found (which also happens to match the only example telegrams I have) was found here: http://www.m-bus.com/mbusdoc/md8.php

The only match is the "gas" = "3" case.
